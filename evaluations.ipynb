Its energy can be converted into kinetic energy. This energy can turn a turbine and generate electricity. The water may fall naturally over a waterfall or flow through a dam. A drawback of dams is that they flood land upstream. They can also reduce water flow downstream. Either effect may harm ecosystems. Wind Wind is moving air. It has kinetic energy that can do work.

Its energy can be converted into kinetic energy. This energy can turn a turbine and generate electricity. The water may fall naturally over a waterfall or flow through a dam.

One day, Kevin traveled from his home in the United States of America to Erin's house in England. They then thought to take a sudden trip around the world. They first traveled by plane around Europe, where they saw many different people and sights. They then took a boat to Africa and Asia, where they went on a trip through the mountains. Later in the month, they traveled to China by train and were allowed to see how different life was over there. Next they took another plane to Australia, where they had a lot of fun seeing kangaroos and a different type of English speaking people. After spending a week in Australia, Kevin and Erin took a really long plane ride to North America, where they drove across the land. They saw everything from the mountains to forests. They even got to visit the beach! Because they had so much fun, Kevin returned home with Erin to England where they hung out and spent the next few days and months talking about all of the neat things they saw and did on their trip. \", 'question': 'Did Erin and Kevin travel to Africa before or after visiting China?', 'answer': 'Before', 'idx': {'paragraph': 439, 'question': 4943, 'answer': 26328}, 'label': 1, 'input_ids': [101, 3160, 1024, 2106, 11781, 1998, 4901, 3604, 2000, 3088, 2077, 2030, 2044, 5873, 2859, 1029, 3437, 1024, 2077, 102, 2045, 2320, 2001, 1037, 3124, 2315, 4901, 1998, 2611, 2315, 11781, 1012, 2027, 2428, 4669, 5938, 2051, 2362, 1012, 2028, 2154, 1010, 4901, 6158, 2013, 2010, 2188, 1999, 1996, 2142, 2163, 1997, 2637, 2000, 11781, 1005, 1055, 2160, 1999, 2563, 1012, 2027, 2059, 2245, 2000, 2202, 1037, 5573, 4440, 2105, 1996, 2088, 1012, 2027, 2034, 6158, 2011, 4946, 2105, 2885, 1010, 2073, 2027, 2387, 2116, 2367, 2111, 1998, 15925, 1012, 2027, 2059, 2165, 1037, 4049, 2000, 3088, 1998, 4021, 1010, 2073, 2027, 2253, 2006, 1037, 4440, 2083, 1996, 4020, 1012, 2101, 1999, 1996, 3204, 1010, 2027, 6158, 2000, 2859, 2011, 3345, 1998, 2020, 3039, 2000, 2156, 2129, 102], 'token_type_ids': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}.\n",
